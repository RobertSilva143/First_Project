# First_Project
This is my first project in data analytics (SQl and Excel). 
I learned this through free youtube videos.

## About the project

First, in Excel, I created seven different tables. Some of these tables share common columns, such as ColumnID, TransactionID, and EmployeeID. 
Instead of creating relationships between those tables, I combined them into another table named CombinedTable with respect to the TransactionID column.
Lastly, I utilized Pivot tables and created a dashboard to present information extracted from the CombinedTable.


In SQL, I exported these seven tables as CSV files and imported them into SQL Server Management Studio. 
I executed basic SQL queries to derive meaningful insights, including the monthly growth rate of total revenue, 
the average time between consecutive transactions for each customer, and more.
